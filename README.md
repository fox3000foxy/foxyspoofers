## ‚ú® What's new in v1.0.2

- **Graphical redesign:** Complete UI overhaul for a more modern and consistent look.
- **User-Agent spoofer finished:** User-Agent spoofing is now fully functional and configurable.
- **Global settings:** All features except videos are now global (apply to all domains, not just the current one).
- **No more 404 page:** Thanks to using `document_start` in the manifest, the extension now loads before page scripts, preventing 404 errors on some sites.
